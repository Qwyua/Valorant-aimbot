# Valorant aimbot
Unfinished Project: Ready for Development

## Valorant Anti-cheat protection
Making an accurate statement about Valorant cheat protection can be difficult. However, the game developers are taking measures against cheating and fraudulent activities, and these measures are being improved over time. The number of cheating methods is decreasing, but it may not be possible to completely eliminate them.

## Why do we use Arduino?
Valorant has blocked access to almost all Python libraries that involve mouse interactions in the game. In this case, Arduino still remains a viable option for those who want to cheat or engage in fraudulent activities. Arduino is an open-source hardware platform designed for completely legal and ethical purposes and is used by many project developers.

In conclusion, Arduino is an open-source hardware platform that can be used in various projects.
