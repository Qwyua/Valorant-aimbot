## 🛡️ Valorant Anti-Cheat Protection

Valorant uses **Vanguard Anti-Cheat**, a kernel-level security system designed to counter cheating methods. 

- 🔍 **Memory scanning & behavioral detection** techniques actively track suspicious activities.  
- ⚖️ **Kernel-level security** primarily targets software-based cheats.  
- 🔄 **Constant updates** make software exploits increasingly difficult.

Despite these measures, **hardware-based input solutions** can bypass some software restrictions.

## 🔌 Why Use Arduino?

Valorant has blocked most software-based methods that handle mouse interactions in-game. However, **Arduino remains a viable alternative:**

✅ **Bypasses kernel-level restrictions**  
✅ **Recognized as a physical HID input rather than software-based input**  
✅ **Usable for various automation projects beyond Valorant**  

⚡ **Arduino is a legal hardware platform. However, unethical and illegal use is not recommended.**
